# "Back Rooms"

This project is still in development, but is in a playable state. The main gameplay revolves around escaping a randomly generated labyrinth while avoiding a monster. The monster is able to detect the player using multiple metrics including proximity to the player, whether the player is within line of sight, whether the player is in a hiding spot, or if the player is making a lot of noise. There is no way of fighting the monster which was done to make the player more fearful. Instead, the player must run away or hide. 

All assets used were created by me using Blender with textures made using photoshop. The textures were created using photos taken by me or from royalty free sources on the internet. The setting of the game is inspired by the "Back Rooms" urban legend.
