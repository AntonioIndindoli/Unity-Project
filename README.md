# "The Backrooms: Unseen Tapes"

After a sudden malfunction, your elevator plummets to the ground, crashing into an unfamiliar part of your office building. Disoriented, you find yourself trapped in the ominous confines of the Backrooms. With your mind on edge and a deep sense of being hunted, escape becomes your sole focus.

"The Backrooms: Unseen Tapes" is a found footage-style first-person survival horror game that challenges you to navigate through a procedurally generated labyrinthine while avoiding the creatures which inhabit it. Your survival depends on stealth, speed, and strategic thinking. Resources are precious and limited, while the encroaching darkness and the ever-present threat of your stalkers threaten to consume your sanity.
